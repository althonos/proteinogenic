## üîå Usage

This crate builds on top of [`purr`](https://docs.rs/purr), a crate providing
primitives for reading and writing [SMILES].

Use the `AminoAcid` enum to encode the sequence residues, and build a SMILES
string with `proteinogenic::smiles`:

```rust
extern crate proteinogenic;

let sequence = "KGILGKLGVVQAGVDFVSGVWAGIKQSAKDHPNA";
let residues = sequence.chars()
  .map(|c| proteinogenic::AminoAcid::from_code1(c).unwrap());

let s = proteinogenic::smiles(residues);
```

This SMILES string can be used in conjunction with other cheminformatics toolkits,
for instance [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) which can generate a PNG figure:

![Skeletal formula of divergicin 750](https://raw.github.com/althonos/proteinogenic/master/static/divergicin.png)

Note that `proteinogenic` is not limited to building a SMILES string; it can
actually use any [`purr::walk::Follower`](https://docs.rs/purr/latest/purr/walk/trait.Follower.html)
implementor to generate an in-memory representation of a protein formula. If
your code is already compatible with `purr`, then you'll be able to use
protein sequences quite easily.

```rust
extern crate proteinogenic;
extern crate purr;

let sequence = "KGILGKLGVVQAGVDFVSGVWAGIKQSAKDHPNA";
let residues = sequence.chars()
  .map(|c| proteinogenic::AminoAcid::from_code1(c).unwrap());

let mut builder = purr::graph::Builder::new();
proteinogenic::visit(residues, &mut builder);

builder.build()
  .expect("failed to create a graph representation");
```

*The API is not yet stable, and may change to follow changes introduced by
`purr` or to improve the interface ergonomics.*
